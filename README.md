# Anoxic water-ice interfaces of an emerged cold seep host chemoautotrophic microorganisms

This repository contains reproducible R code for the results reported in [Anoxic water-ice interfaces of an emerged cold seep host chemoautotrophic microorganisms]().
It is used for the analysis of 16S amplicon data from samples collected at the Lagoon Pingo (Svalbard) in March 2021 (ice cores, water reservoir, snow).

## Reproducible code

### Source code

[BriefReport_Reproducible_code](https://github.com/lmdelpech/MethanIce-BriefReport-LP-ICE-2021/blob/main/BriefReport_Reproducible_code.Rmd) - Reproducible code as provided an R markdown file. It contains:  

* 0-Source functions: A section compiling custom functions used downstream in the code. If reusing these function, please cite the corresponding repository or article. 
* 1-Data wrangling: Reproductible code for generation of ASVs and parsing of the ASV table. The ASV table resulting from that step has further been deposited on [UiT Dataverse](). 
* 2-4: Those sections reproduce the results and figures presented in the publication.

### Metadata

This folder contains the qPCR data used in section 2 of the script and sample metadata used throughout the script. 

### Functions

This folder contains custom functions sourced in the main script. 

## Documents

[BriefReport_Reproducible_code](https://github.com/lmdelpech/MethanIce-BriefReport-LP-ICE-2021/blob/main/Documents/BriefReport_Reproducible_code.md) contains the compiled version of the reproducible code to visualize the script outputs.
